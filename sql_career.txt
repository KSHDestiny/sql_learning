Data Analyst
    - Data Analysts are responsible for gathering and organizing data to present in a report that helps people understand a story
    - They often gather the data into spreadsheets, or other tools to present data in tables, charts and graphs.
    - For smaller datasets, Excel works great. For complex and larger datasets, the data will be stored in a data warehouse or a relational database.

    Analytics
        - Building on skills in the marketing field
        - Creating code to calculate web analytics
        - Developing visualizations and dashboards

    Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
        - Indicates of progress toward an intended result. (eg: total and unique visitors, bounce rates, page views)

    Data Visualization
        - The graphic representation of data to help tell a story
        - Good Visualization uses Images, Colors, Shapes, Sizes

        Data Visualization Tools
            - Microsoft Power BI
            - Tableau
            - Google Data Studio
            - Microsoft Excel

Data Engineer
    - Data engineers help organizations extract, transform, and load data from one source to another
    - Data engineering requires in-depth knowledge of SQL
    - Developing and maintaining online store and Mobile App
    - Gathering Data and Transforming for Analysis
    - Protecting Data and Servers
    - Builds pipelines to prepare data for the needs of an organization
    - Data engineers need to have expertise in translating data for the needs of analysts, software developers, and data scientists
    - Data engineers take massive amounts of raw, unstructured data from various sources, transform it into formats that the organization needs and load them into data warehouses

    Engineering
        - Translating skills into data engineering, web, and mobile development
        - May apply SQL and other object-oriented programming languages like Python

    Data Engineers are familiar with
        - Python
        - Linux and Unix commands
        - Secure FTP
        - API development
        - Encryption Protocols

    ETL
        - Extract
        - Transform
        - Load

    ETL tools for Big Data
        - MapReduce
        - Hive
        - Spark

Database Administrator (DBA)
    - Database administrators are responsible for troubleshooting the database management system, along with supporting the hardware and software related to both the database and server where the database is located
    - Creates and maintains databases for an organization
    - Keeping database secure from internal and external threats
    - Maintaining regular backups
    - Working with software developers to write efficient queries
    - Troubleshoot the database management system (DBMS)
    - Support hardware and software for the database and associated servers
    - Manage security access and storage
    - Have familiarity with server operating systems
    - DBAs use Data Manipulation Language(DML) and Data Definition Language(DDL)

Data Science
    - SQL use in descriptive and predictive analytics
    - May apply other programming languages like Python and R
    - Data Science uses Math, Statistics, Computer Science, Scientific method
    - Data Scientists use SQL along with other languages and tools for data preparation, evaluation, and then use tools for predictive analytics using artificial intelligence like machine learning
    - Aggregate Functions (sum, average, count, minimum, maximum, median, standard deviation, variance, mode, correlation coeffic)
    - Data scientist use SQL's built-in statistical functions to discover data insights and patterns
    
    Goal
        - Find insights that can help us interpret the past based on patterns and trends

    Traditional Predictive Modeling
        - Extract data from data warehouse
        - Data scientists create initial models
        - Initial models fed new data
        - Machine learning techniques are applied (such as regression, classification, clustering)

    New Predictive Modeling
        - Create machine learning models right in SQL syntax


SQLite
    - Lightweight DBMS
    - Works on Android and IOS
    - Distributed solutions may not be the best application for SQLite
